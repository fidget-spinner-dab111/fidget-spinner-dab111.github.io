<h1>How Bias Affected Our Bias Project</h1>
<p>Before Ryan began to do any research for the Gendah Bias in De werkplayse
page, he wrote a paragraph at the top saying that after many hours of research
we were able to conclude that there was a very slight but very miniscule bias
in hiring but other than that our research concluded that in the workplace
gender bias does not exist.</p>

<p>I find this to be a perfect example of bias for our project because he wrote
this before doing any research. So, part of my contribution to the project will
be analyzing Ryan's subconscious bias and how it affected our project.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>If it doesn't support my argument, it's wrong</h2>
<p>Ryan's subconscious bias affected how he interpreted sources of information
for the page. For example, he would hesitantly avoid left leaning news articles, sites
and online newspapers because they were biased against the view he wanted to portray.</p>
<p>Before the information even reaches our page, it
passes through his brain filter and based on his own ideas, political
alignment, and the media he deems worthy, the content is subject to a rigid
selection that inevitably leaves out many sides of the story.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>This orange is not wearing pants</h2>
<p>Even if the information passes his subconscious selection process, it is
then changed in his brain and a modified result is put on the page. Nobody can
stop this intentional modification of ideas. Once the information is displayed
on the website it has already gone through two mental filters to remove any
sources or ideas that do not align with Ryan's ideas.
</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>This is the only part of the website with actual information on it</h2>
<p>Ryan starts off his argument with a quick introduction and then uses
passed government legislation to prove that pay bias does not exist. He cites
"the equal pay act of 1963" and "the equal pay act of 1970". The equal pay act
of 1963 abolished wage disparity based on sex. The equal pay act of 1970 did
the same thing but in the United Kingdom. I do somewhat agree that this
government legislation helps stop these biases, but not completely.

<p>This is where it begins to go downhill. From here, without any specific
topic in mind, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and 1964 are cited as completely outlawing bias
on race, gender, origin, and religion. More specifically, the act of 1866
affirmed the right of citizenship to any person born in the US as long as they
are not "subject to foreign power". The meaning of what Ryan said is not clear.
It is extremely hard to control someone's thoughts even if they are against the
law. While this law does exist, the effectiveness of it against bias are
questionable. You'd think that if these equality acts are so effective, only
these two would be necessary? The last equality act was in 2015, showing that
there is still bias present that the government is taking action against.
</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>all of this was a mistake</h2>
<p>Then bias in the courthouses and the court system in general is discussed.
Ryan says that most of the time in a divorce scenario the women won the kids
and most of the money. Apart from the fatal generality of this statement (what
money?), it is only supported by one source. </p>
<p>He then moves on to talking about
the importance of a father in a child's life and two of the three sources he
provides are about that topic. So it is believed that there's bias against
fathers in court custody cases. However, around 51% of custody cases end with
both paretnts agreeing that the mother be the custodial parent. How can the
results be biased against males when more than half the time the court is not
involved in the outcome of the decision? Therefore, to assume that judges or
the "court system in general" have a bias against fathers is ludicrous!
