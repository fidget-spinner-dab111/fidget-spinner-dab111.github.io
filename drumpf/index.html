    <h1>Social Justice Hacking</h1>
    <p>
      I hate the straight, white men on github. They make sites like <a href="https://fidget-spinner-dab111.github.io">this one</a>. This site makes fun of gender bias in our society. We need to fight this oppression with ethical hacking. Hate speech is not protected by the first amendment so we should destroy the lives of evil people who write this stuff.
