<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I am making this out of my own boredom, and because I am incontent with Ryan's bias and because I would like to add to Jacob's explanation of Ryan's bias. I will also directly copy Jacob's pages and 'pick them apart' to remained 'unbiased'.</p>

<h2>Ryan's Incompetence</h2>
<p>I think Jacob explained Ryan's researching behaviors pretty well, but there are many things I would like to add. I've noticed while arguing against Ryan that I don't necessarily have to understand the topic and I will still make Ryan quiet down or 'win' the argument because Ryan has so many flawed behaviors</p>
