<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I am making this out of my own boredom. I have created this because I am incontent with Ryan's bias and because I would like to add to Jacob's explanation of Ryan's bias. I will also directly copy Jacob's pages and 'pick them apart' to remained 'unbiased'.</p>

<h2>Ryan's Incompetence</h2>
<p>I think Jacob explained Ryan's researching behaviors pretty well, but there are many things I would like to add. I've noticed while arguing against Ryan that I don't necessarily have to understand the topic and I will still make Ryan quiet down or 'win' the argument because Ryan has so many flawed behaviors. For example, especially when I am in possession of an electronic device, I sometimes look up information that Ryan claims is true. When an answer pops up in Google, Ryan might look over at what Google gave as an answer, and as Jacob pointed out, when Ryan sees the answer, it is processed in his brain through his mental filters which often prevent him from comprehending all of what the text says. He can control this behavior, as it is not programmed into his genes, but he chooses not to. He automatically sees what he wants to see, and whatever he doesn't want to see is automatically glazed over.</p>
